- **Orders**: Contains information about customer orders, including the total amount and status.
- **Products**: Stores information about products (e.g., coffee, ingredients) available in the shop.
- **Order_Items**: Contains details about individual items in an order.
- **Product_Recipes**: Stores the recipe for each product, including ingredients and their quantities.
- **Cup_Contents**: Stores the contents of each cup, linking products and ingredients.
